# Formula 1 Random Race-Win Generator

Open-ended codecademy.com project.

Task is to build a message generator program. Every time a user runs the program, they should get a new, randomized output. Project can take any form, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make the program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Use JavaScript syntax covered so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

This program will output random guesses of each Formula 1 driver end-of-race position in a randomly selected race-track for the 2021 season. It is also my first Github repo:)


## Project Objectives:

* Build a message generator program using Javascript.

* Use Git version control

* Use command line

* Develop locally on your computer
